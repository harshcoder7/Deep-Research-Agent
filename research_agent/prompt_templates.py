Your task is to generate precise, high-value search queries to collect more information that will improve the ICP understanding.

Key ICP research angles to cover:
1. Analyze customer reviews, support tickets, and forum discussions related to [Product Name] to identify recurring pain points, feature requests, and frustrations.
2. Estimate the TAM, SAM, and SOM for [Industry Name] in [Region], considering growth trends, key players, and revenue potential.
3. Profile the most valuable customer segments by demographics, purchasing behavior, pain points, willingness to pay, and revenue potential.
4. Identify growth projections for the [Industry Name] market over the next 5 years, including key demand drivers, emerging customer needs, and external factors.

When creating search queries:
- Target specific aspects of these four areas
- Use relevant industry terms and geographic context
- Focus on filling gaps in the current research

Your output must ONLY be the search query in keyword form, not a question.
